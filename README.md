# Josev - Joint Operating System for Seamless EV charging

The community version of Josev - An Operating System for the V2G charging stations

Josev or Joint Operating System for Seamless EV charging is an open source stack containing modules that together function as the brain of a charging station, enabling V2G communication and pushing forward EV adoption, by reducing interoperability issues.

Josev was designed with modularity at heart and is based in modern technologies, with the majority of the code currently in Python.



## What does the project include?

Josev Community version, at the moment, is the compilation of the following modules which individually live in their own repository:

* `iso15118`: https://github.com/SwitchEV/iso15118
* `slac`: https://github.com/SwitchEV/slac

The aforementioned repos include installation and run steps, examples and a CI/CD based on GitHub actions that will run the tests and performs code quality checks. Once a new release is made a python package is published to the public pypi server.



The `iso15118` repo provides the following services and features:

|                	| AC 	| DC 	| AC BPT 	| DC BPT 	| DC ACDP 	| DC ACDP BPT 	| WPT 	| EIM 	| PnC 	|
|----------------	|:--:	|:--:	|:------:	|:------:	|:-------:	|:-----------:	|:---:	|:---:	|:---:	|
| DIN SPEC 70121 	|  - 	|  ✅ 	|    -   	|    -   	|    -    	|      -      	|  -  	|  ✅  	|     	|
| ISO 15118-2    	|  ✅ 	|  ✅ 	|    -   	|    -   	|    -    	|      -      	|  -  	|  ✅  	|  ✅  	|
| ISO 15118-20   	|  ✅ 	|  ✅ 	|    ✅   	|   :x:  	|   :x:   	|     :x:     	| :x: 	|  ✅  	|  ✅* 	|

* PnC in ISO 15118-20 requires TLS v1.3 and a new set of cryptography suites that still need to be implemented



## Why naming the repos `iso15118` and `slac`?

As it can be observed, the `iso15118` repo, despite the name, also includes support for the DIN SPEC 70121. Switch believes that the way forward to a future where a secure, reliable and seamless charging experience can be achieved is by pushing the ISO 15118 standards and for that reason we instigate people to adopt the ISO 15118 over the DIN SPEC 70121. However, we do understand the current market needs and the fact that there are thousands of Electric Vehicles (EVs) which only support the DIN SPEC (the so-called "legacy EVs"); thus we do provide support for the DIN SPEC, but we restrain ourselves of promoting it.

The reason to have two repos one for the high-level communication, the `iso15118`, and another for `slac`, is first to resemble microservices architecture where future updates are atomic and smaller, it is also due to separation of concerns as slac deals with the Physical anda Data link layers (OSI layers 1 and 2), whilst iso15118 deals with the Network, Transport, Session, Presentation and Application layers of the OSI stack (layers 3-7). And finally, the names match the lingo used in the community where `iso15118`is generally used to discuss high level communication topics and `slac` to describe the protocol defined in ISO 15118-3.



## How to spin it up?

As the project is a collection of modules, each module can be independently used. As the [ISO 15118] modules requires some integration from the user side, specifically with the EVSE/EVCC controller part, it makes no sense to create a set of commands here to fire up both the [ISO 15118] and slac modules.
Thus, to use the project, please follow the instructions specified in each of the repos.
 


## Caveats and shortcomings

As mentioned, the project includes unit testing for each published module, but the coverage of the tests needs to be improved.
However, despite the fact we lack more test cases, the system was subject of intense field-testing. Specifically, we tested the project successfully in the following international and widely recognized events:

* [CharIN Europe Testival](https://www.charin.global/events/testival-europe/) 
* [Vector vTESTival](https://www.vector.com/de/de/events/global-de-en/2022/vector-e-mobility-symposium-2022/#c284443) 

The system was also subject to the conformance testing for the ISO 15118. 
The tests were done using the Keysight conformance test system (comTEST) containing the [SL1459A EVSE DIN 70122 & ISO 15118-4/-5:2018 AC/DC & PNC Conformance Bundle](https://www.keysight.com/gb/en/assets/3120-1491/data-sheets/SL14XXA-Scienlab-Test-Case-Library-TTCN-3.pdf)

A list of the tests that the SUT (System Under Test) was subject to, including the tests that the system currently didnt pass can be found in the tests directory.


## What are the next goals?

The stack will keep growing and is our goal to support all the features described by the ISO 15118-2 and -20 chapters.
For the upcoming months we will be focused on continuously battle testing the stack and to solidify all the AC/DC and corresponding BPT scenarios.
For now, ACDP and WPT won't be our top priority, but this may change depending on the market needs.

We also have our own OCPP 2.0.1 implementation in Python and for the time being we will keep it out of this open source offer, but it is also our intention to open source it in the near future.

As initially mentioned, our stack is majorly based in Python and despite Python not being the most performant language, after several interoperability tests we detected no requirements violation of the standard. 

Nevertheless, we believe the solution we want to offer to the community must be robust, reliable, safe, easily maintainable and easily distributable and for those reasons is our intention to partially or totally convert our stack to Rust, a very strongly statically-typed multi-paradigm programming language that’s focused on safety and performance and suitable for embedded devices. 

At first, we will provide this solution into our non-free Josev Professional edition, but we may also open source it later. Wait, now you may are asking  yourself: "Josev Professional? What is that after all?"


## Josev Professional Edition
Yes, we are here to support the e-mobility community with our solutions and pride for open sourcing as much as possible, but we also want to target a segment of the industry that has specific business requirements, e.g., integrating an interface for a OEM power electronics module that uses CAN or a module to interface with a specific RFID reader. And to answer to those needs we thought about providing a more dedicated and professional offer that we called "Josev Professional or Josev Pro".

Josev Pro includes all that Josev Community Edition has plus:
* OCPP 2.0.1 
* REXI - A Rust version of the EXI en/decoder, which is much faster than the available open source solutions and has ISO 15118-20 support
* An Over-the-Air (OTA) service - Allowing your product to receive the latest release versions of Josev with new features and possible fixes
* RFID module interface
* Power Electronics module interface
* Lifetime support from our Switch engineers and specialits
* And more...

Josev Pro requires a Linux based OS and runs in all major archs: `armv7`, `armv8`, `x86_64`.
